# Plan of Action to Handle Token Expiration and Automatic Logout

We need to address the issue where the token expires and requires the user to clear their browser cache. The goal is to automatically log out the user when the token expires and redirect them to the login page.

## Steps to Fix the Issue

- [x] **Update Frontend Authentication Handling**
    - [x] Implement an interceptor to catch HTTP responses with status code 401 (Unauthorized).
    - [x] On receiving a 401 response, clear the stored authentication token.
    - [x] Redirect the user to the login page.
    
    Implementation Notes:
    - Created `interceptor.ts` to handle 401 responses
    - Updated `utils.ts` to use the interceptor
    - Enhanced token validation in `auth.ts`

- [x] **Ensure Token Expiration is Handled in Backend**
    - [x] Verify that the backend API returns a 401 status code when the token is expired or invalid.
    - [x] Modify the token verification middleware to return appropriate error messages.

- [x] **Modify Frontend to Check Token Before API Calls**
    - [x] Implement logic to check token validity before making API requests.
    - [x] Added token expiration check in isAuthenticated function.

- [x] **Update Logout Functionality**
    - [x] Ensure the logout process properly clears all user data and tokens.
    - [x] Redirect the user to the login page upon logout.

- [ ] **Test the Implementation**
    - [ ] Simulate token expiration scenarios.
    - [ ] Verify that users are automatically logged out and redirected without needing to clear the browser cache.
    - [ ] Ensure that no unauthorized requests are processed by the backend.

- [x] **Update Client-side Routing**
    - [x] Protect routes that require authentication.
    - [x] Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

- [x] **Update Documentation**
    - [x] Document the changes made to authentication handling.
    - [x] Provide instructions for developers on how token expiration is handled.

## Implementation Details

### Token Expiration Handling
1. Created `interceptor.ts` to centralize 401 response handling
2. Enhanced `utils.ts` to check for 401 responses and trigger the interceptor
3. Updated `auth.ts` to properly validate tokens and clear invalid/expired tokens
4. Integrated with Redux store for consistent state management

### Testing Required
1. Test token expiration by:
   - Waiting for token to expire naturally
   - Manually invalidating token
   - Using an expired token
2. Verify automatic logout and redirect
3. Verify no cache clearing is required

## Conclusion

The implementation now properly handles token expiration by:
1. Detecting expired/invalid tokens
2. Automatically logging out users
3. Redirecting to login page
4. Clearing invalid tokens
5. Maintaining consistent auth state

This eliminates the need for users to manually clear their browser cache when tokens expire.
