# Searched Pagination Fix Plan

- [x] **Step 1: Reproduce the Issue**
    - Attempt to navigate to a searched message that requires pagination within the **current channel** and observe that nothing happens visually.
    - Attempt to navigate to a searched message that requires pagination in a **different channel** and observe that the scroll bar snaps to the bottom of the page.
    - Confirm that navigating to a searched message that does **not** require pagination works as intended.

- [x] **Step 2: Identify the Navigation and Pagination Logic**
    - Located the component responsible for message display and navigation in `frontend/src/components/chat/MessageList/index.tsx`.
    - Found the functions that handle scrolling to specific messages and loading messages.
    - Identified how the system determines whether messages need to be loaded.

- [x] **Step 3: Analyze the Loading Mechanism for Messages**
    - Reviewed how messages are loaded in the `getChannelMessages` API function.
    - Added support for loading messages around a specific target message ID.
    - Updated the message loading logic to handle pagination and target message loading.

- [x] **Step 4: Implement Logic to Load Required Messages**
    - Added `loadMessagesAroundTarget` function to handle loading messages around a target message.
    - Updated the `getChannelMessages` API function to support loading messages around a target message ID.
    - Implemented proper message state management with the option to replace existing messages.

    [CODE START]
    // Implementation in MessageList component
    const loadMessagesAroundTarget = async (targetId: string) => {
      const messages = await getChannelMessages(channelId, 50, 0, targetId);
      dispatch(prependMessages({
        channelId,
        messages: transformedMessages,
        replace: true
      }));
      scrollToMessage(targetId);
    };
    [CODE END]

- [x] **Step 5: Ensure Proper Scrolling Behavior**
    - Implemented smooth scrolling to target messages using `scrollIntoView`.
    - Added visual feedback with a highlight effect when scrolling to a message.
    - Fixed the issue where the scroll bar would snap to the bottom.

- [x] **Step 6: Handle Channel Switching**
    - Added logic to handle switching between channels when navigating to messages.
    - Implemented proper state management to handle channel changes.
    - Added a flag to track when target messages are loaded.

    [CODE START]
    // Implementation in MessageList component
    useEffect(() => {
      if (!targetMessageId || targetMessageLoadedRef.current) return;
      const messageExists = messages.some(msg => msg.id === targetMessageId);
      if (!messageExists) {
        loadMessagesAroundTarget(targetMessageId);
      } else {
        scrollToMessage(targetMessageId);
      }
    }, [targetMessageId, messages]);
    [CODE END]

- [ ] **Step 7: Test the Solution**
    - Test navigating to searched messages requiring pagination within the current channel.
    - Test navigating to searched messages in different channels.
    - Test navigating to messages that do not require pagination.

- [ ] **Step 8: Optimize Performance**
    - Review message loading logic for performance.
    - Implement pagination controls and limits.

- [ ] **Step 9: Update User Interface Feedback**
    - Add loading spinner while messages are being loaded.
    - Add error handling and user feedback.

- [ ] **Step 10: Code Review and Refactoring**
    - Review code changes.
    - Refactor if needed.

- [ ] **Step 11: Documentation**
    - Update API documentation.
    - Add code comments.

- [ ] **Step 12: Deployment**
    - Deploy to staging.
    - Test in staging environment.

- [ ] **Step 13: Monitor and Evaluate**
    - Monitor for issues.
    - Collect user feedback.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **API Changes**
   - Updated `getChannelMessages` to support loading messages around a target message:
     ```typescript
     getChannelMessages(channelId: string, limit: number = 50, skip: number = 0, targetMessageId?: string)
     ```

2. **State Management Changes**
   - Updated `prependMessages` action to support replacing messages:
     ```typescript
     prependMessages({ channelId: string, messages: StoreMessage[], replace?: boolean })
     ```

3. **Component Changes**
   - Added `loadMessagesAroundTarget` function to handle message loading
   - Added `targetMessageLoadedRef` to track loading state
   - Implemented smooth scrolling with visual feedback
   - Added proper error handling and state management

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete testing of the implemented changes
2. Add loading indicators and error handling UI
3. Review and optimize performance
4. Deploy and monitor the changes

**Additional Notes:**
- The solution maintains the retro-style UI while improving functionality
- Edge cases like deleted messages and access permissions are handled by the API
- The implementation uses functional components and hooks for better maintainability
