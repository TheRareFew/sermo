# Channel Access Implementation Plan

## 1. Database Schema Changes

### A. Update Channel Model
- [ ] Add `is_public` boolean field to channels table (default=True)
- [ ] Keep existing `channel_members` association table for private channels
- [ ] Keep existing relationships and indexes

### B. Migration Steps
1. [ ] Create new Alembic migration
2. [ ] Add `is_public` column to channels table
3. [ ] Set all existing channels to public (is_public=True)
4. [ ] Update indexes if needed

## 2. Backend Changes

### A. Update Channel Schema
1. [ ] Modify ChannelBase schema to include is_public field
2. [ ] Update ChannelCreate and Channel response schemas
3. [ ] Add validation for is_public field

### B. Update Channel API Endpoints
1. [ ] Modify GET /api/channels/ to:
   - [ ] Return all public channels
   - [ ] Include private channels where user is a member
   - [ ] Add filter query param for public/private channels

2. [ ] Modify POST /api/channels/ to:
   - [ ] Accept is_public field
   - [ ] Handle member_ids for private channels only
   - [ ] Validate member_ids when channel is private

3. [ ] Update channel member management endpoints:
   - [ ] Restrict member operations to private channels only
   - [ ] Add validation to prevent member management on public channels
   - [ ] Add proper error messages for invalid operations

4. [ ] Update channel access checks in:
   - [ ] Message endpoints
   - [ ] File endpoints
   - [ ] WebSocket connections

### C. Update Authorization Logic
1. [ ] Modify channel access checks to:
   - [ ] Allow access to all public channels
   - [ ] Check membership only for private channels
   - [ ] Add proper error handling

## 3. Frontend Changes

### A. Update Channel Types
1. [ ] Add isPublic field to Channel interface
2. [ ] Update channel-related state management
3. [ ] Modify channel creation form types

### B. Update Channel Creation
1. [ ] Modify CreateChannelModal to:
   - [ ] Add public/private toggle
   - [ ] Show/hide member selection based on privacy setting
   - [ ] Update validation logic

### C. Update Channel List
1. [ ] Modify channel list display to:
   - [ ] Show public/private status indicators
   - [ ] Add visual distinction between public and private channels
   - [ ] Update channel sorting/grouping

### D. Update Channel Management
1. [ ] Modify channel settings to:
   - [ ] Show member management only for private channels
   - [ ] Add invite functionality for private channels
   - [ ] Update access control UI elements

### E. Update WebSocket Integration
1. [ ] Update connection logic to handle:
   - [ ] Public channel access
   - [ ] Private channel restrictions
   - [ ] Error handling for access violations

## 4. Testing

### A. Backend Tests
1. [ ] Add tests for:
   - [ ] Public/private channel creation
   - [ ] Channel access controls
   - [ ] Member management restrictions
   - [ ] Authorization logic

## 5. Documentation

### A. API Documentation
1. [ ] Update API docs with:
   - [ ] New channel fields
   - [ ] Modified endpoint behaviors
   - [ ] Access control rules

### B. Frontend Documentation
1. [ ] Update component docs with:
   - [ ] New props and interfaces
   - [ ] Changed behaviors
   - [ ] Usage examples

## 6. Migration Guide

### A. Data Migration
1. [ ] Document steps for:
   - [ ] Updating existing channels
   - [ ] Handling existing memberships
   - [ ] Verifying data integrity

### B. API Changes
1. [ ] Document:
   - [ ] Breaking changes
   - [ ] New features
   - [ ] Migration steps for API consumers
