# Channel Access Implementation Plan

## 1. Database Schema Changes

### A. Update Channel Model
- [x] Add `is_public` boolean field to channels table (default=True)
- [x] Keep existing `channel_members` association table for private channels
- [x] Keep existing relationships and indexes

### B. Migration Steps
1. [ ] Create new Alembic migration
2. [ ] Add `is_public` column to channels table
3. [ ] Set all existing channels to public (is_public=True)
4. [ ] Update indexes if needed

## 2. Backend Changes

### A. Update Channel Schema
1. [x] Modify ChannelBase schema to include is_public field
2. [x] Update ChannelCreate and Channel response schemas
3. [x] Add validation for is_public field

### B. Update Channel API Endpoints
1. [x] Modify GET /api/channels/ to:
   - [x] Return all public channels

### C. Update Authorization Logic

   - [x] Add proper error handling

## 3. Frontend Changes

### A. Update Channel Types

2. [x] Update channel-related state management
3. [x] Modify channel creation form types

### B. Update Channel Creation
1. [x] Modify CreateChannelModal to:
   - [x] Add public/private toggle
   - [x] Show/hide member selection based on privacy setting
